## Overview

The Unbalance Lab is a 2D sci-fi puzzle-platformer crafted for the Gamedev.js Jam 2025, themed "Balance." 

Built in Unity 2022.3.47f1 LTS, the game tasks players with guiding a robot through lab levels, collecting red and blue energies from totems to unlock doors with exact energy requirements. 

Balance is key: too little energy leaves obstacles blocking paths and fails the door; too much clears all obstacles but overshoots the door’s needs; only the precise energy amount clears some obstacles and opens the door. Obstacles vanish with sufficient energy but reappear if energy drops. 

Developed by a two-person team—one programmer and one artist—this project showcases our collaborative effort.

Built for WebGL to meet jam requirements.

## Controls

WASD / Arrow Keys: Move the robot.

Space: Activate or deactivate totems.
